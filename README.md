# Jonathan Malloy Portfolio
This repository contains my portfolio of projects as I work towards learning how to be a full stack developer. 

Through an MIT sponsered 32 week coding bootcamp, I am learning technologies like Javascript/HTML/CSS for front end developmen and the MERN stack for back end development

This portfolio represents my projects to date. I will be updating it as I practice and learn more. 

Enjoy!
Jon Malloy
